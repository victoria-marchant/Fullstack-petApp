An app that was to show off puppies now slowly being made into a pet hub. Upload your pets with their info so they can join the pack. You can also update or take them down.


This app has a focus on back end processing so the UI is still pretty ugly and bare at this stage. It uses external and internal apis and multer is in the process of being incorporated to make image upload possible. Eventually it will have individual profile pages and potentially sign in capacity.
